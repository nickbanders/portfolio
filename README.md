# Week 2 Challenge: Portfolio

## So, heres the deal...
 * I had been trying to create the page using collapsible menus all week but I could never get it working correctly. Obviously bit off more than I can chew!

## Scrapped that project and started a new page at 6pm Sunday night!
 * It's obvious I utlized resources from prior projects but tried to mix it up some.
 * I looked up how to create a CSS class that made your images grey scale and added a hover to bring them back to color.
 * LinkedIn link is directed to the main page as I don't have a LinkedIn set up yet.
